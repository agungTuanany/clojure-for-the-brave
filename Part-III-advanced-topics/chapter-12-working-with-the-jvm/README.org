There comes a day in every Clojurist's life when she must venture forth from the
sanctuary of pure functions and immutable data structures into the wild,
barbaric Land of Java. This treacherous journey is necessary because Clojure is
hosted on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which grants it three fundamental
characteristics. First, you run Clojure applications the same way you run Java
applications, Second, you need to use Java objects for core functionality like
reading files and working with dates. Third, Java has a vast ecosystem of useful
libraries, and you'll need to know a bit about Java to use them.

In this way, Clojure is a bit like a utopian community plunked down in the
middle of a dystopian country. Obviously you'd prefer to interact with other
utopians, but every once in a while you need to talk to the locals in order to
get things done.

This chapter is like a cross between a phrase book and cultural introduction for
the Land of Java. You'll learn what the JVM is, how it runs programs, and how to
compile programs for it. This is chapter will also give you a brief tour of
frequently used Java classes and methods, and explain how to interact with them
using Clojure. You'll learn how to think about and understand Java so you can
incorporate any Java library into your Clojure programs.

To run the examples in this chapter, you'll need to have the Java Development
Kit (JDK 9) version 1.6 or later installed on your computer. You can check by
running /javac -version/ at your terminal. You should see something like java
1.8.0_40; if you don't, visit http://www.oracle.com/ to download the latest JDK.

* The JVM

Developers use the term JVM to refer to a few different things. You'll hear them
say "Clojure runs on /the/ JVM," and you'll also hear, "Clojure programs run in
/a/ JVM." In the first case, JVM refers to an abstraction--the general model of
the Java Virtual Machine. In the second, it refers to a process--an instance of
a running program. We'll focus on the JVM model, but I'll point out when we're
talking about running JVM processes.

To understand the JVM, let's step back and review how plain ol'computers work.
Deep in the cockles of a computer's heart is its CPU, and the CPU's job is to
execute operation like /add/ and /unsigned multiply/. You've probably heard
about programmers encoding these instruction on punch cards, in lightbulbs, in
the sacred cracks of a tortoise shell, or /whatever/, but nowdays these
operations are represented in assembly language by mnemonics like ADD and MUL.
The CPU architecture (x86, ARMv7, and what have you) determines what operations
are available as part of the architecture's /instruction set/.

Because it's not fun to program in assembly language, people have invented
higher-level language like C and C++, which are compiled into instructions that
CPU will understand. Broadly speaking, the process is:

1. The compiler reads source code.

2. The compiler outputs a file containing machine instructions.

3. The CPU executes those instruction.

Notice in Figure 12-1 that, ultimately, you have to translate program into
instructions that CPU will understand, and he CPU doesn't care which programming
language you use to produce those instructions.

The JVM is analogues to a computer in that it also needs to translate code into
low-level instructions, and called /Java bytecode/. However, as a /virtual/
machine, this translation is implemented as software rather than hardware. A
running JVM executes bytecode by translating it on the fly into machine code
that its host will understand, a process called /just-in-time compilation/.

#+attr_latex: scale=0.75
#+label: fig:listing
[[file:figures-listing-and-images/Figures-12-1.png]]

For a program to run on the JVM, it must get compiled to Java bytecode. Usually,
when you compile programs, the resulting bytecode is saved in a /.class/ file.
Then you'll package these files in /java archive files/ (JAR files). And just
like how a CPU doesn't care which programming language you use to generate
machine instructions, the JVM doesn't care how you create bytecode. It doesn't
care if you use Scala, JRuby, Clojure, or even Java to create Java bytecode.
Generally speaking, the process looks like that shown if Figure 12-2.

1. The Java compiler reads source code.

2. The compiler outputs bytecode, often to a JAR file.

3. JVM executes the bytecode.

4. The JVM sends machine instructions to the CPU.

When someone says that Clojure runs on the JVM, one of the things they means is
that Clojure programs get compiled to Java bytecode and JVM processes execute
them. From an operations perspective, this means you treat Clojure programs the
same as Java programs. You compile them to JAR files and run them using the java
command. If a client needs a program that run on the JVM, you could secretly
write it in Clojure instead of Java and they would be none the wiser. From the
outside, you can't tell the difference between a Java and Clojure program any
more than you can tell the difference between C and C++ program. Clojure allows
you to be productive and sneaky.

* Writing, Compiling, and Running a Java Program

Let's look at how real Java program works. In this section, you'll learn about
the object-oriented paradigm that Java uses. Then, you'll build a simple pirate
phrase book using Java. This will help you feed more comfortable with the JVM,
it will prepare you for the upcoming section on Java interop (writing Clojure
code that uses Java classes, objects, and methods directly), and it'll come in
handy should a scallywag ever attempt to scuttle your booty on the high seas. To
tie all the information together, you'll take a peek at some of Clojure's Java
code at the end of the chapter.

** Object-Oriented Programming in the World’s Tiniest Nutshell

Java is an object-oriented language, so you need to understand how
object-oriented programming (OOP) works if you want to understand what's
happening when you use Java libraries or write Java interop code in your Clojure
programming.

I think of objects as really, really, ridiculously dumb androids. They're the
kind of android that would never inspire philosophical debate about the ethics
of forcing sentient creatures into perpetual servitude. These androids only do
two things; they respond to command and they maintain data. In my imagination
they do this by writing stuff down on little Hello Kitty clipboard.

Imagine a factory that makes these androids. Both the /set/ of commands the
android understands and the set of data it maintains are determined by the
factory that makes the android. In OOP terms, the *factories* corresponds to
/classes/, the *androids* correspond to /objects/, and the *commands* correspond
to /methods/. For example, you might have a /ScaryClown/ factory (class) that
produces androids (objects) that respond to the command (method)
/makeBallonArt/. The android keeps track of the number of balloons it has, and
then updated that number whenever the number of balloons changes. It can report
that number with /ballonCount/ and receive any number of balloons with
/receiveBallons/. Here's how you might interact with a Java representing Belly
Rubs the Clown.

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  ScarryClown bellyRubsTheClown = new ScaryClown();
  bellyRubsTheClown.ballonCount();
  // => 0

  bellyRubsTheClown.receiveBallons(2);
  bellyRubsTheClown.ballonCount();
  // => 0

  bellyRubsTheClown.makeBallonArt();
  // => "Belly Rubs makes a ballon shaped like a clown, because Belly Rubs
  // => is trying to scare you and nothing is scarier tha clowns."
#+end_src

This example shows you how to create a new object, /bellyRubsTheClown/, using
the /ScaryClown/ class. It also shows you how to call methods (such as
/ballonCount/, /receiveBallons/, and /makeBallonArt/) on the object, presumably
so you can terrify children.

One final aspect of OOP that you should know, or at least how it's implemented
in Java, is that you can also send commands to the factory. In OOP terms, you
would say that classes also have methods. For example, the built-in class /Math/
has many class methods, including /Math.abs/, which returns the absolute value
of number:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  Math.abs(-50)
  // => 50
#+end_src

I hope those clowns weren't too traumatizing for you. Now let's put your OOP
knowledge to work!.

** AHOY, World

Go ahead and create a new directory called /phrasedbook/. In that directory
create a file called /PiratePhrases.java/, and write the following:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  public class PiratePhrases
  {
      public static void main (String[] args)
      {
          system.out.println("Shiver me timbers!!!");
      }

  }
#+end_src

This is very simple program will print the phrase "Shiver me timbers!!!!" (which
is how pirates say "Hello, world!") to your terminal when you run it. It
consists of /class/, /PiratePhrases/, and a static method belonging to that
class, /main/. Static method are essentially class methods.

In your terminal, compile the /PiratePhrases/ source code with the command
/javac PiratePhrases.java/. If you type everything correctly and you're pure of
heart, you should see a file named /PiratePhrases.class/:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  $ ls
  PiratePhrases.class
  PiratePhrases.java
#+end_src

You've just compiled your first Java program, me matey! Now run it with /java
PiratePhrases/ You should see this:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  Shiver me timbers!!!
#+end_src

What's happening here is you used the Java compiler, /javac/, to create Java
class file, /PiratePhrases.class/. This file is packed with oodles of Java
bytecode (well, for a program this size, maybe only one oodle).

When you ran /java PiratePhrases/, the JVM first looked at your /classpath/ for
a class named /PiratePhrases/. The classpath is the list of filesystem paths
that JVM searches to find a file that defines a class. By default, the classpath
includes the directory you're in when you run java. Try to running /java
-classpath /tmp PiratePhrases/ and you'll get an error, even though
/PiratePhrases.class/ is right there in your current directory.

#+begin_quote
You can have multiple paths on your classpath by separating them with colons if
you're on a Mac or running Linux, or semicolons if you're using Windows. For
example, the classpath /tmp:/var/maven:, includes the /tmp, /var/maven, and /./
directory.
#+end_quote

In Java, you're allowed only one public class per file, and the filename must
match the class name. This is how /java/ knows to try blocking in
/PiratePhrases.class/ for the /PiratePhrases/ class, it executed that class's
/main/ method. Java's similar to C in that whenever you say "run something, and
use this class as your entry point," it will always run that class's /main/
method; therefore, that method must be /public/, as you can see in the
/PiratePhrases/'s source code.

In the next section you'll learn how to handle proram code that spans multiple
files, and how to use Java libraries.

* Packages and Imports

To see how to work with multi-file programs and Java libraries, we'll compile
and run a program. This section has direct implication for Clojure because
you'll use the same ideas and terminology to interact with Java libraries.

Let's start with a couple definitions:

/*package*/. Similar to Clojure's namespaces, packages provide code
organization. Packages contain classes, and package names correspond to
filesystem directories. If a file has the line Package /com.shapemaster/ in
it, the directory /com/shapemaster/ must exists somewhere on your classpath.
Within that directory will be files defining classes.

/*import*/. Java allows you to import classes, which basically means that you
can refer to them without using their namespace prefix. So if you have a class
in /com.shapemaster/ named /Square/, you could write /import
com.shapemaster.Square/; or /import com.shapemaster.*/; at the top of a
/.java/ file to use /Square/ in your code instead of /com.shapemaster.Square/.

Let's try using /package/ and /import/. For this example, you'll create a
/package/ called /pirates_phrases/ that has two classes, /Greetings/ and
/Farewells. To start, navigate to your /phrasebook/ and within that directory
create another directory, /pirate_phrases/. It's necessary to create
/pirate_phrases/ because Java package names correspond to filesystem
directories. Then, create /Greeting.java/ within the /pirate_phrases/ directory:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  package pirate_phrases;  // [L-1]

  public class Greetings
  {
      public static void hello()
      {
          System.out.prtinln("Shiver me timbers!!!");
      }
  }
#+end_src

At [L-1], /package pirate_phrases/; indicates that this class will be part of
the /pirate_phrases/ package. Now create /Farewells.java/ within the
/pirate_phrases/ directory:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  package pirate_phrases;
  public class Farewells
  {
      public static void goodbye()
      {
          System.out.println("A fair turn of the tide ter ye thar, ye magnificent sea friend!!");
      }
  }
#+end_src

Now create /PirateConversation.java/ in the /phasebook/ directory:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  import pirate_phrases.*;

  public class PirateConversation
  {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
          Greetings greetings = new Greetings();
          greetings.hello();

          Farewells farewells = new Farewells();
          farewells.goodbye();
      }
  }
#+end_src

The first line, /import pirate_phrases.*;/, imports all classes in the
/pirate_phrases/ package, which contain the /Greetings/ and /Farewells/ classes.

If you run /javac PirateConversation.java/ within the /phrasebook/ directory
followed by /java PirateConversation/, you should see this:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  shiver me timbers!!!
  A fair of the tide ter ye thar, ye magnificent sea friend!!
#+end_src

And thar she blows, dear reader. Thar she blows indeed.

Note that, when you're compiling a Java programming, Java searches your
classpath for packages. Try typing the following:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  cd pirate_phrases
  java ../PirateConversation.java
#+end_src

You'll get this:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  ../PirateConversation.java:1: error: package pirate_phrases does not exist
  import pirate_phrases.*;
#+end_src

Boom! The Java compiler just told you to hang your head in shame maybe weep a
little.

Why? It thinks that the /pirate_phrases/ package doesn't exist. But that's
stupid, right? You're in the /pirate_phrases/ directory?

What's happening here is that the default classpath only includes the current
directory /phrasebook/pirate_phrases/pirate_phrases/, which doesn't exists. When
you run /java ../PirateConversation.java/ from within the /phrasebook/
directory, /javac/ tried to find the directory /phrasebook/pirate_phrases/,
which does exist. Without changing directories, try running /javac -classpath
../../PirateConversation.java/. Shiver me timbers, it works! This works because
you manually set the classpath to the parent directory of /pirate_phrases/,
which is /phasebook/. From there, /javac/ can successfully find the
/pirate_phrases/ directory.

In summary, packages organize code and require a matching directory structure.
Importing classes allows you to refer to them without having to prepend the
entire class's package name. /javac/ and /java/ find packages using the
classpath.

** Package & Import review phrasebook code

The code is not running well with Java-25. So I need to rerun with Java-17. The
problem is:

The book assume:

  1. Compile '.java' files directly using paths
  2. run everything form the top-level directory
  3. Java classpath rules were looser (Java 6/7)
  4. Module didnot exists.

Today (Java 17+):

  1. Classpath resolution is strict
  2. Direct .java execution didn't exist in Java 7
  3. Running .java files inside nested package never worked, not even then.

So, we rewrite all the files. We create a root folder named \'java-phrasebook'\,
and create inside of it the folder named \'phrasebook'\ and file inside of it
with two files named \PiratePhrases.java\ and \PirateConversation.java\, and we
create the third folder named \'pirate_phrases'\, inside \pirate_phrases\ we
create two files named \Greetings.java\ and \Farewells.java\. So we have the
tree structure be like:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  /java-phrasebook $ tree
  .
  └── phrasebook
      ├── PirateConversation.java
      └── PiratePhrases.java
      ├── pirate_phrases
      │   ├── Farewells.java
      │   └── Greetings.java
#+end_src

let's create /PiratePhrases.java/ file:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  package phrasebook;
  import phrasebook.pirate_phrases.*; // notice we use complete path

  public class PiratePhrases
  {
      public static void main (String[] args)
      {
          System.out.println("Shiver me timbers!!!");
      }
  }
#+end_src

Next, we create second file name /PirateConversation.java/:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  package phrasebook;
  import phrasebook.pirate_phrases.*;  // notice we use complete path

  public class PiratePhrases
  {
      public static void main (String[] args)
      {
          System.out.println("Shiver me timbers!!!");
      }
  }
#+end_src

Then we create two files inside /pirate_phrases/ folder, first /Greetings.java/:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  package phrasebook.pirate_phrases; // notice we use complete path

  public class Greetings
  {
      public static void hello()
      {
          System.out.println("Shiver me timbers!!!");
      }
  }
#+end_src

and second file named /Farewells.java/:

#+begin_src java :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  package phrasebook.pirate_phrases; // notice we use complete path

  public class Farewells
  {
      public static void goodbye()
      {
          System.out.println("A fair turn the tide ter ye thar, ye magnificent sea friend!!");
      }
  }
#+end_src

 we clean all
compiled files that create /.class/ files.

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  java-phrasebook $ find phrasebook -name "*.class" -delete
#+end_src

then, comp

now, we start to compile sub-path first before in the main path:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  java-phrasebook: /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/bin/javac phrasebook/pirate_phrases/*.java
#+end_src

then, we compile the main path:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  java-phrasebook $ /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/bin/javac -cp . phrasebook/*.java
#+end_src


so, we get the tree structure:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
.
├── java-broke.org
└── phrasebook
    ├── PirateConversation.class
    ├── PirateConversation.java
    ├── pirate_phrases
    │   ├── Farewells.class
    │   ├── Farewells.java
    │   ├── Greetings.class
    │   └── Greetings.java
    ├── PiratePhrases.class
    └── PiratePhrases.java

3 directories, 9 files
#+end_src

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  java-phrasebook $ /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/bin/java -cp .
  phrasebook.PirateConversation

  Shiver me timbers!!!
  A fair turn the tide ter ye thar, ye magnificent sea friend!!
#+end_src

Allright, we did it.

So we use java-17 to compile it.

* JAR Files

JAR files allows you to bundle all your /.class/ files into one single file.
Navigate to your /phrasebook/ directory and run the following:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  java-phrasebook$ jar cvfe conversation.jar phrasebook.PiratePhrases -C . phrasebook

  added manifest
  adding: phrasebook/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)
  adding: phrasebook/PirateConversation.class(in = 426) (out= 292)(deflated 31%)
  adding: phrasebook/PirateConversation.java(in = 305) (out= 170)(deflated 44%)
  adding: phrasebook/PiratePhrases.class(in = 451) (out= 304)(deflated 32%)
  adding: phrasebook/PiratePhrases.java(in = 198) (out= 143)(deflated 27%)
  adding: phrasebook/pirate_phrases/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)
  adding: phrasebook/pirate_phrases/Farewells.class(in = 477) (out= 337)(deflated 29%)
  adding: phrasebook/pirate_phrases/Farewells.java(in = 201) (out= 150)(deflated 25%)
  adding: phrasebook/pirate_phrases/Greetings.class(in = 434) (out= 306)(deflated 29%)
  adding: phrasebook/pirate_phrases/Greetings.java(in = 158) (out= 124)(deflated 21%)
#+end_src

Now we test to run the JAR:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  java-phrasebook$ java -jar conversation.jar

  Shiver me timbers!!!
  #+end_src

This display the pirate conversation correctly. You bundled all the class files
into /conversation.jar. Using the /e/ flag, you also indicated that the
/PirateConversation/ class is the /entry point/. The entry point is the class
that contains the /main/ method that should be executed when the JAR as a whole
runs, and /jar/ stores this information in the file /META-INF/MANIFEST.MF/
within the JAR file. If you were to read that file, it would contain this line:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  Main-Class: PirateConversation
#+end_src

By the way, when you execute JAR files you don't have to worry which directory
you're in, relative to the file. You could change to the /pirate_phrases/
directory and run /java -jar ../conversation.jar/, and it would work fine.The
reason is that the JAR maintains the directory structure. You can see it
contents /jar tf conversation.jar/, which output this:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  META-INF/
  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
  phrasebook/
  phrasebook/PirateConversation.class
  phrasebook/PirateConversation.java
  phrasebook/PiratePhrases.class
  phrasebook/PiratePhrases.java
  phrasebook/pirate_phrases/
  phrasebook/pirate_phrases/Farewells.class
  phrasebook/pirate_phrases/Farewells.java
  phrasebook/pirate_phrases/Greetings.class
  phrasebook/pirate_phrases/Greetings.java
#+end_src

You can see that the JAR file includes the /pirate_phrases/ director. One more
fun fact about JAR's : they're really just ZIP files with a /.jar/ extension.
You can treat them the same as any other ZIP file.

* clojure.jar

Now you're ready to see how Clojure works under the hood! Download the 1.7.0 or
the newest stable release


#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  curl -O https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar
#+end_src

and run it, or inspect on the clojure-1.11.1.jar:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  drwxr-xr-x       0   5-Apr-2022 09:35:52  META-INF/
  -rw-r--r--     127   5-Apr-2022 09:35:50  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
  drwxr-xr-x       0   5-Apr-2022 09:34:02  clojure/
  drwxr-xr-x       0   5-Apr-2022 09:33:52  clojure/asm/
  drwxr-xr-x       0   5-Apr-2022 09:33:50  clojure/asm/commons/
  drwxr-xr-x       0   5-Apr-2022 09:34:02  clojure/test/
  drwxr-xr-x       0   5-Apr-2022 09:34:00  clojure/instant/
#+end_src


You should see the most soothing of sights, the Clojure REPL. How did it
actually start up? Let's look at /META-INF/MANIFEST.MF/ in the JAR file:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  Manifest-Version: 1.0
  Archiver-Version: Plexus Archiver
  Created-By: Apache Maven
  Built-By: jenkins
  Build-Jdk: 1.8.0_111
#+end_src

It looks like /clojure.main/ is specified as the entry point. Where does this
class come from? Well, have a look at /clojure/main.java/ on GitHub at
dhttps://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/main.java:

      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          RT.init();
          REQUIRE.invoke(CLOJURE_MAIN);
          MAIN.applyTo(RT.seq(args));
      }
  }
#+end_src

As you can see, the file defines a class named /main/. It belongs to the package
/clojure/ and defines a /public static main/ method, and the JVM is completely
happy to use it as an entry point. seen this way, Clojure is a JVM program just
like any other.

This wasn't mean to be an in-depth java tutorial, but I hope that it helped
clarify what programmers mean when they talk about Clojure "running on the JVM"
or being a "hosted" language. In the next section, you'll continue to explore
the magic of the JVM as you learn how to use additional Java libraries within
your Clojure project.

* Clojure App JARs

You know how Java runs Java JARs, but how does it run Clojure apps bundled as
JARs? After all, Clojure applications don't have classes, do they?

As it turns out, you can make the Clojure compiler generate a class for a
namespace by putting the /(:gen-class)/ directive in the namespace declaration.
(You can see this in the very first Clojure program you created, /clojure-noob/
in Chapter 1. Remember that program, little teapot?) This means that the
compiler produces the bytecode necessary for the JVM to treat the namespace as
if it defines a Java class.

You set the namespace of the entry point for your program in the program's
/project.clj/ file, using the /:main/ attribute, for /clojure-noob/, you should
see /:main ^:skip-aot clojure-noob.core/. When Leiningen compiles this file, it
will add a /meta-inf/manifest.mf/ file that contains the entry point to the
resulting JAR file.

So, if you define a /-main/ function in a namespace and include the
/(:gen-class)/ directive, and also /set :main/ in your /project.clj/ file, your
program will have everything it needs for Java to run it when it gets compiled
as a JAR. You can try this out in your terminal by navigating to your
/clojure-noob/ directory and running this:

#+begin_src bash :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  lein uberjar

  java -jar target/uberjar/clojure-noob-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

  I'm a litle teapot!
#+end_src

You should see two messages printed out: "Cleanliness is next to godliness" and
"I'm little teapot!" Note that you don't need leiningen to run the JAR file; you
can send it to friends and neighbors and they can run it as long as they have
Java installed.

* Java Interop

One of Rich Hickey's design goals for Clojure was to create /practical/
language. For that reason, Clojure was designed to make it easy for you to
interact with Java classes and objects, meaning you can use Java's extensive
native functionality and its enormous ecosystem. The ability to use Java
classes, objects, and methods is called /java interop/. In this section, you'll
learn how to use Clojure's interop syntax, how to import Java packages, and how
to use the most frequently used Java classes.

** Interop Syntax

Using Clojure's interop syntax, interacting with Java Objects and classes is
straightforward. Let's start with object interop syntax.

You can call all Clojure strings are implemented as Java strings, you can call
Java methods on them:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (.toUpperCase "By Blubeard's Bananas!")
  ;; => "BY BLUBEARD'S BANANAS!"

  (.indexOf "Let's synergize our bleeding edges" "y") ;; [L-1]
  ;; => 7
#+end_src

Notice that Clojure's syntax allows you to pass arguments to Java methods. In
this example, at [L-1] you passed the argument /"y"/ to the /indexOf/ method.

You can also call static methods on classes and access classes' static fields.
Observe!

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (java.lang.Math/abs -3)  ;; [L-1]
  ;; => 3

  (java.lang.Math/PI)  ;; [L-2]
  ;; => 3.141592653589793
#+end_src

At [L-1] you called the /abs/ static method on the /java.lang.Math.class/, and
at [L-2] you accessed that class's /PI/ static field.

All of these example (except /java.lang.Math/PI/) use macros that expand to use
the /dot special form/. In general, you won't need to use the dot special form
unless you want to write your own macros to interact with Java objects and
classes. Nevertheless, here is each example followed by its macroexpansion:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (macroexpand-1 '(.toUpperCase "By Bluebeard's bananas!"))
  ;; => (. "By Bluebeard's bananas!" toUpperCase)

  (macroexpand-1 '(.indexOf "Let's synergize our bleeding edges" "y"))
  ;; => (. "Let's synergize our bleeding edges" indexOf "y")

  (macroexpand-1 '(Math/abs -3))
  ;; => (Math/abs -3)
#+end_src

This is general form of the dot operator:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
(. object-expr-or-classname-symbol method-or-member-symbol optional-args*)
#+end_src

The dot operator has a few capabilities, and if you're interested in exploring
it future, you can look at clojure.org's documentation on Java interop at
https://clojure.org/reference/java_interop#Java%20Interop-The%20Dot%20special%20form

** Creating and Mutating Objects

The previous section showed you how to call methods on objects that already
exist. This section shows you how to create new objects and how to interact with
them.

You can create a new object in two ways: /(new ClassName optional-args*)/ and
/(ClassName. optional-args*)/:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (new String)
  ;; => ""

  (String.)
  ;; => ""

  (String. "To Davey Jone's Locker with ye hardies")
  ;; => "To Davey Jone's Locker with ye hardies"
#+end_src

Most people use the dot version. /(ClassName.)/.

To modify an object, you call methods on it like you did in the previous
section. To investigate this, let's use /java.util.Stack/. This class represents
a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack of objects, or just /stack/. /Stack/ are a
common data structure, and they're called stack because you can visualize them
as a physical stack of objects, say, a stack of gold coins that you just
plundered. When you add a coin to your stack, you add it to the top of the
stack. When you remove a coin, you remove it from the top. Thus, the last object
added is the first object removed.

Unlike Clojure data structure, Java stack are mutable. You can add items to them
and remove items, changing the object instead of deriving a new value. Here's
how you might create a stack and add an object to it:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (java.util.Stack.)
  ;; => []

  (let [stack (java.util.Stack.)]  ;; [L-1]
    (.push stack "Latest episode of Game of Thrones, ho!")
    stack)
  ;; => ["Latest episode of game of Thrones, ho1"]
#+end_src

There are a couple of interesting details here. First, you need to create a
/let/ binding for /stack/ like you see at [L-1] and add it as the last
expression would be the string /"Latest episode of Game of Throne, ho!"/ because
that's the return value of /push/.

Second, Clojure prints the stack with square brackets, the same textual
representation it uses for a vector, which throw you because it's not a vector.
However, you can use Clojure's /seq/ functions for reading a data structure,
like /first/, on the stack:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (let [stack (java.util.Stack.)]
    (.push stack "Latest episode of Game of Throne, ho!")
    (first stack))
  ;; => "Latest episode of Game of Throne, ho!"
#+end_src

But you can't use functions like /conj/ and /into/ to add elements to the stack.
If you do, you'll get an exception. It's possible to /read/ the stack using
Clojure function because Clojure extends its abstraction to /java.util.Stack/, a
topic you'll learn about in Chapter 13.

Clojure provices the /doto/ macro, which allows you to execute multiple methods
on the same object more succinctly:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (doto (java.util.Stack.)
    (.push "Latest episode of Game of Throne, ho!")
    (.push "Whoops, I meant 'land, ho!'"))
  ;; => : ["Latest episode of Game of Throne, ho!" "Whoops, I meant 'land, ho!'"]
#+end_src

The /doto/ macro returns the object rather than the return value of any of the
method calls, and it's easier to understand. If you expand it using
/macroexpand-1/, you can see its structure is identical to the /let/ expression
you just saw in an earlier example:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (macroexpand-1
   '(doto (java.util.Stack.)
      (.push "Latest episode of Game of Throne, ho!")
      (.push "Whoops, I mean 'Land, ho!")))

  ;; => (clojure.core/let
  ;; =>     [G__9263 (java.util.Stack.)]
  ;; =>   (.push G__9263 "Latest episode of Game of Throne, ho!")
  ;; =>   (.push G__9263 "Whoops, I mean 'Land, ho!")
  ;; =>   G__9263)
#+end_src

Convenient!

** Importing

In Clojure, importing has the same effect as it does in Java; you can use
classes without having to type out their entire package prefix:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (import java.util.Stack)
  (Stack.)
  ;; => []
#+end_src

You can also import multiple classes at once using this general form:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
    (import [package.name1 ClassName1 ClassName2]
            [package.name2 ClassName3 ClassName4])
#+end_src

Here's an example:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (import [java.util Date Stack]
          [java.net Proxy URI])

  (Date.)
  ;; => #inst "2025-11-26T23:09:16.803-00:00"
#+end_src

But usually, you'll do all your importing in the /ns/ macro, like this:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (ns pirate.talk
    (:import [java.util Date Stack]
             [Java.net Proxy URI]))
#+end_src

The two different methods of importing classes have the same results, but the
second is usually preferable because it's convenient for people reading your
code to see all the code involving naming in the /ns/ declaration.

And that's how you import classes! Pretty easy. To make life even easier,
Clojure automatically imports the classes in /java.lang/, including
/java.lang.String/ and /java.lang.Math/, which is why you were able to use
/String/ without a preceding package name.

* Commonly Used Java Classes

To round out this chapter, let's take a quick tour of the Java classes that
you're most likely to use.

** The System Class

The /System/ class has useful class fields and methods for interacting with the
environment that your program's running in. You can use it to get environment
variables and interact with the standard input, standard output, and error
output streams.

The most useful methods and members are /exit/, /getenv/, and /getProperty/. you
might recognize /System/exit/ from Chapter 5, where you used it to exit the Peg
thing game. /System/exit/ terminates the current program, and you can pass it a
status code as an argument. If you're not familiar with status codes, I
recommend Wikipedia's "Exit Status" article at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status.

/System/getenv/ will return all of your system’s environment variables as a map:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (System/getenv)
  {"USER" "the-incredible-bulk"
   "JAVA_ARCH" "x86_64"}
#+end_src

One common use for environment variables is to configure your program.

The JVM has its own list of property separate from the computer's environment
variables, and if need to read them, you can use /System/getProperty/:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (System/getProperty "user.dir")  ;; [L-1]
  ;; =>"/home/daunjrk/Documents/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/Part-III-advanced-topics/chapter-12-working-with-the-jvm"

  (System/getProperty "java.version")  ;; [L-2]
  ;; => "25.0.1"
#+end_src

The first call [L-1] returned the directory that the JVM started from, and the
second call at [L-2] returned the version of the JVM.

** The Date Class

Java has good tools for working with dates. I won't go into too much details
about the /java.util.Date/ class because the online API documentation (available
at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Date.html) is through. As
a Clojure developer, you should know there features of this /date/ class. First,
Clojure allows you to represent dates as literals using a form like this:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  #isnt "2016-09-19|20:40:02.733-00:00"
#+end_src

Second, you need to use the /java.util.DateFormat/ class if you want to convert
string to dates. Third, if you're doing tasks like comparing dates or trying to
add minutes, hours, or other units of time to a date, you should use the
immensely useful clj-time library (which you can check out at
https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time).

* Files and Input/Output

In this section you'll learn about Java's approach to input/output (IO) and how
Clojure simplifies it. The /clojure.java.io/ namespace provides many handy
functions for simplifying IO
(https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.java.io-api.html). This is great
because Java IO isn't exactly straightforward. Because you'll probably want to
perform IO at some point during your programming career, let's start wrapping
your mind tentacles around it.

IO involves resources, be they files, sockets, buffers, or whatever. Java has
separate classes for reading a resource's contents, for writing its contents,
and for interacting with the resource's properties.

For examples, the /java.io.File/ class is used to interact with a file's
properties:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (let [file (java.io.File. "/")]
    (println (.exists file))    ;; [L-1]
    (println (.canWrite file))  ;; [L-2]
    (println (.getPath file)))  ;; [L-3]

  ;; => true
  ;; => false
  ;; => /
    #+end_src

Among other tasks, you can use it to check whether a file exists, to get the
file's /read/write/execute permissions, and to get its filesystem path, which
you can see at [L-1], [L-2], [L-3], respectively.

Reading and writing are noticeable missing from this list of capabilities. To
read a file, you could use the java.io.BufferReader/ class or perhaps
/java.io.FileReader/. Likewise, you can use the /java.io/BufferedWriter/ or
/java.io.FileWriter/ class for writing. Other classes are available for reading
and writing as well, and which one you choose depends on your specific needs.
Reader and writer methods all have the same base set of methods for their
interfaces; readers implement /read/,/close/,and more, while writers implements
/append/, /write/, /close/, and /flush/. Java gives you a variety of IO tools. A
cynical person might say that Java gives you enough rope to hang yourself, and
if you find such a person, I hope you give them a hug.

Either way, Clojure makes reading and writing easier for you because it includes
functions that unify reading and writing across different kinds of resources.
For example, /spit/ writes to a resource, and /slurp/ reads from one. Here's an
example of using them to write and read a file:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (spit "/tmp/hercules-todo-list"
        "- kill dat lion brov - chop up what nasty multi-headed snake thing")

  (slurp "/tmp/hercules-todo-list")
  ;; =>"- kill dat lion brov - chop up what nasty multi-headed snake thing"
  #+end_src

You can also use these function with objects representing resources other than
files. The next example uses a /StringWriter/, which allows you to perform IO
operations on a string:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (let [s (java.io.StringWriter.)]
    (spit s "- capture hind like for real")
    (.toString s))
  ;; => "- capture hind like for real"
#+end_src

You can also read from a /StringReader/ using /slurp/:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (let [s (java.io.StringReader. "- get erymanthian pig what with the tusks")]
    (slurp s))
  ;; => "- get erymanthian pig what with the tusks"
#+end_src

In addition, you can use the /read/ and /write/ methods for resources. It
doesn't really make much difference which you use; /spit/ and /slurp/ are
convenient because they work with just a string represent a filesystem path or a
URL.

The /with-open/ macro is another convenience: it implicitly closes a resource at
the end of its body, ensuring that you don't accidentally tie up resources by
forgetting to manually close the resource. The /reader/ function is a handy
utility that, according to the /clojure.java.io API docs, "attempts to coerce
its argument to an open /java.io.Reader/." This is convenient when you don't
want to use /slurp/, because you don't want to try to read a resource in its
entirely and you don't want to figure out which Java class you need to use. You
could use /reader/ along with /with-open/ and the /line-seq/ function if you're
trying to read a file one line at a time. Here's how you could print just the
first item of the Hercules todo list:

#+begin_src clojure :results value verbatim :exports both eval: never-export
  (with-open [todo-list-rdr (clojure.java.io/reader "/tmp/hercules-todo-list")]
    (println (first (line-seq todo-list-rdr))))
  - kill dat lion brov
#+end_src

That should be enough for you to get started with IO in Clojure. If you're
trying to do more sophisticated tasks, definitely check out the
/clojure.java.io/ docs, the /java.io.file/ package docs, or the /java.io/
packages docs.

* Summary

In this chapter, you learned what it means for Clojure to be hosted on the JVM.
Clojure programs get compiled to Java bytecode and executed within a JVM
process. Clojure programs also have access to Java libraries, and you can easily
interact with them using Clojure's interop facilities.
