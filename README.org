* What this is about?

I've been watching Clojure since 2015, but I'm not sure enough my path from deep
knowledge JavaScript jump into Clojure. At that time JavaScript environment so
adequate

I try to learn with re-write and try one by one the code examples. There is view
in last chapter the code examples didn't match between the REPL result with the
book result. So I try to figure it out.

In end of chapter there's exercise, I try to do it.

At that time, the JavaScript environment was developing rapidly with the
implementation of ECMA-6, while I was just stuck with various frameworks that
had been developed. I was so focused on frameworks that I forgot about the basic
languages and paradigms and got caught in a rabbit hole of JavaScript
frameworks, to the point that I didn't learn and make JavaScript powerful enough
to do everything.

In 2020, I became fascinated with Emacs and tried to read about its origins,
which led me directly to LISP. LISP is a programming language that is more than
half a decade old and is still used as one of the languages for AI development.
I was fascinated by how LISP untangled the complex logic of programming, making
it clear what was happening behind the scenes. I began writing my own Emacs
configurations in a modular way, ensuring they didn't depend on one another.

Then I came across this book, which thoroughly teaches the fundamentals of
Clojure in Part II, covering syntax, data structures, functions, and how they
all come together.

In Part III, the book explains concurrency, which includes futures, delays, and
promises, with comprehensive case studies.
